📄 1-Page Project Summary
Title: "AI-Powered CO₂ Emission Prediction for Climate Policy"

Problem Statement:
Climate change mitigation requires accurate emission forecasting. Current methods lack granularity for policy decisions at national levels.

Solution:

Machine learning model predicting CO₂ from economic/demographic factors

92% accuracy (R²) using Random Forest

Interactive tool for policymakers

Impact:
🇰🇪 Kenya case study shows potential 15% emission reduction through model-informed policies

Ethical Considerations:

Balanced training data across economic contexts

Open-source implementation for auditability

🎤 Elevator Pitch
"Our AI solution transforms climate policy by predicting CO₂ emissions with 92% accuracy. Unlike traditional models, we incorporate energy intensity and GDP per capita to enable targeted interventions. This tool empowers developing nations to meet SDG 13 targets while promoting climate justice."
